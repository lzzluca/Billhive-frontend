Known issues:
* Login
    - Register post is still broken

* General
    - It is missing, in the top bar, a label with name (and avatar) of the
      logged in user. It could also being used as button that opens a dropdown,
      to access the user profile, logout, etc…
    - The webapp is not full responsive (I think it can still fits tablets but
      not smartphones). To be fixed by introducing Bootstrap

* Transactions page
    - Many minor style issues
    - It is using some fake data (they are not fetched from the server)
    - The list shows some data that does not respect the filters (“this month”
      and “others”), that is on purpose, only to show a filled in list!

* Details page:
    - It is still a fake :( All of what is shown, is just images, there is nothing dynamic
    - At the moment is broken and doesnt load the images correctly
